The interaction of the central ion with the group of ions decays faster than $1/r$. The direct spherical truncation breaks the ordering of the ions at the cut off sphere providing a net charge within the cutoff sphere. The breaking of the charge ordering increases with the crystal dimension resulting in a large net charge in the higher dimensional crystal.}}{18}{figure.1.5}
